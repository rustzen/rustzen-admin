# rustzen-admin

A structured monorepo foundation for Rust full-stack admin systems.

> `rustzen-admin` combines an Axum backend, a React frontend, and repository-level documentation in a single codebase designed for clear boundaries, maintainability, and AI-friendly collaboration.

## Overview

`rustzen-admin` is an open-source full-stack admin system foundation built for real-world projects, not just isolated UI demos.

The repository is organized as a monorepo:

- `zen-core/` contains shared auth and permission capabilities for Rust services
- `zen-server/` contains the Rust backend application
- `zen-web/` contains the React frontend application
- `deploy/` contains deployment assets and release support files
- `docs/` contains repository-level guides plus goals, plans, specs, and agent-facing documents
- the root keeps shared commands, workspace metadata, and collaboration entry documents

This layout keeps backend, frontend, and repository rules explicit, making the codebase easier to understand, review, and evolve.

## Why this repository

Many admin repositories optimize for getting pages running quickly, but become harder to maintain once features, permissions, and data flow start to grow.

`rustzen-admin` is built around a different goal:

- explicit backend and frontend boundaries
- reusable auth and permission capability layers
- feature-oriented backend organization
- repository-level documentation and collaboration rules
- synchronized changes across code, contracts, and docs
- a structure that is easier for contributors and AI tools to work with
