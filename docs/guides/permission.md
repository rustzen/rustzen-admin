# Permission Guide

Current capability, module delegation, and menu-reconciliation rules.

## Ownership

- `crates/auth/` owns shared auth types, capability constants, and Admin-native
  route permission checks.
- `crates/ipc/` owns module route access metadata and HMAC delegated context.
- `apps/admin/src/infra/permission.rs` owns the in-memory user permission cache,
  built-in role policy, and transactional module menu reconciliation.
- `apps/admin/src/features/modules/` owns fixed module enabled state, Manifest
  synchronization, the immutable runtime registry, and gateway authorization.
- Module Rust route registration is the single source for method, path, public
  or protected access, and required capability.

## Capability rules

- Admin-native routes use `PermissionsCheck::Require(...)` by default. Use
  `Any(...)` or `All(...)` only for a concrete feature need.
- Capability strings use colon-separated business intent, such as
  `system:user:list`, `monitor:view`, and `reports:manage`.
- `*` is the full grant. Prefix wildcards authorize matching colon-separated
  children.
- `users.is_system`, `roles.is_system`, and `menus.is_system` are record flags,
  not grants.
- User capabilities come from role-menu relations only. A missing permission
  cache entry may be rebuilt from SQLite at authentication time, but a warm
  gateway request never queries the database.

## Built-in roles

- `owner` is the only built-in role that receives `*` and the only role that
  may apply, roll back, delete, or clean up releases.
- `admin` receives concrete module capabilities and deploy view access.
- `viewer` receives concrete read-only capabilities and deploy view access.
- Built-in roles cannot be edited or deleted through role management.
- Ordinary role forms cannot assign `*` or release mutation capabilities.

## Module synchronization

Each module's `module.toml` stores only module identity and default menu
presentation. Rust `ModuleRouter` registration generates the route portion of
the runtime Manifest.

Admin periodically fetches enabled module Manifests outside the request path,
validates the fixed identity and contract, and transactionally reconciles:

- module-owned capability rows;
- default module menus;
- built-in role grants derived from the current capability catalog.

Existing custom-role leaf grants are preserved and newly introduced
capabilities remain unassigned. During the breaking split only, a legacy
`monitor:*`, `insights:*`, or `reports:*` custom-role relation is expanded once
to the exact capabilities in that module's first valid Manifest, then the
wildcard relation is retired so later capabilities are not granted implicitly.

Only after the database transaction commits is the immutable runtime registry
swapped. Invalid or incompatible changes return the module to unavailable state
without partial menu, permission, or route updates. `menus.is_manual = TRUE`
preserves manual presentation overrides. Disabled modules are not polled and
remain unavailable until a fresh valid Manifest is synchronized after
re-enabling.

## Request flow

1. Admin matches method and full path in the in-memory registry.
2. For a protected route, Admin decodes the JWT and checks the one required
   capability against the in-memory permission cache.
3. Admin creates an HMAC context containing one user ID and one access value;
   it never forwards roles or a full permission set.
4. The module verifies signature freshness, method, path, module, identity, and
   its exact local route capability before executing the handler.

Public routes skip user authorization but still require signed Admin delegation
at the module boundary. Direct unsigned requests are rejected.

## Prohibited

- super-admin or old-binary fallback logic;
- treating `is_system` as authorization;
- route or permission duplication in TOML or a second registry;
- database, TOML, Manifest, or discovery work in the gateway hot path;
- forwarding complete user roles or capabilities;
- silent or partial Manifest reconciliation.
