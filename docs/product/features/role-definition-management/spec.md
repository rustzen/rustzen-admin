# Role Definition Management

## Goal and implementation slice

Allow an authorized operator to create and maintain custom roles without
weakening the built-in owner boundary or confusing unavailable permission data
with an empty permission catalog.

## Users and scenarios

- An operator with role-list access can find roles by name, code, and status.
- An operator with role-create or role-update access can define one custom role
  with at least one assignable permission.
- An operator with role-delete access can remove an unused custom role.
- Operators can inspect built-in roles but cannot edit or delete them.

## Confirmed decisions

- `owner`, `admin`, and `viewer` are built-in roles and remain immutable through
  generic role management.
- Built-in role codes are reserved and cannot be reused by custom roles.
- A custom role requires at least one assignable permission.
- Ordinary custom roles cannot receive the full `*` grant, owner-only
  capabilities, or wildcards that cover owner-only capabilities.
- Disabling a role preserves its definition and user assignments but stops that
  role from contributing capabilities. Disabled roles are not offered for new
  user assignments.
- A role that is still assigned to one or more users cannot be deleted.
- Successful role creation, update, or deletion refreshes effective user
  permissions.
- Fixed user-facing copy is available in Simplified Chinese and English.

## Scope and non-goals

In scope:

- paginated role discovery with name, code, and status filters;
- distinct initial loading, empty, and error states with retry;
- custom-role creation and editing with name, code, status, description, and
  assignable permissions;
- distinct permission loading, empty, and error states inside the role dialog;
- permission search without changing the selected permission set;
- explicit destructive confirmation and an assigned-role deletion refusal;
- capability-gated list, create, update, and delete actions.

Non-goals:

- editing or deleting built-in roles;
- assigning owner-only capabilities to custom roles;
- changing the capability vocabulary or module Manifest ownership;
- bulk role operations, role cloning, or role hierarchy;
- changing user-role assignment behavior, which has its own feature slice;
- redesigning the role page or shared form system.

## Main and failure flows

1. The role page loads a paginated list and exposes only actions allowed by the
   current operator's capabilities.
2. Initial list failure shows an error and retry action rather than a valid
   empty table.
3. Opening a create or edit dialog loads the current assignable permission
   catalog without clearing entered role fields.
4. Permission loading, failure, and a successful empty result remain distinct.
   Failure provides a retry action that preserves current form input and
   selected permission IDs.
5. Submission remains unavailable until the permission catalog is ready, at
   least one assignable permission is selected, local fields are valid, and no
   request is already running.
6. Successful creation or update closes the dialog, refreshes the role list,
   and refreshes effective user permissions.
7. Deletion requires confirmation. An assigned role remains intact and returns
   a clear refusal; an unused custom role is soft-deleted and the list refreshes.

## Business rules and permissions

- Listing, creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving role options use their
  existing capability boundaries.
- UI visibility is not the security boundary; the backend validates immutable
  built-in roles, reserved codes, non-empty permissions, owner-only capability
  exclusions, and assigned-role deletion refusal.
- Unknown or stale permission IDs do not authorize a role. Existing database
  and service validation remain authoritative for request failure.
- Disabling a role takes effect when the permission cache refresh completes as
  part of the successful update.

## User-visible states and data effects

- **List loading/error/empty/populated:** one explicit state at a time.
- **Permission loading/error/empty/populated:** contained within the open role
  dialog; retry preserves role fields and selected permissions.
- **Submitting:** one request at a time; the primary action remains disabled.
- **Delete blocked:** the role and assignments remain unchanged.
- **Create/update/delete success:** role persistence and effective permission
  cache are updated together through the existing service path.

## Acceptance criteria

- A role-list request failure is never rendered as an empty role list and can
  be retried.
- Built-in roles expose no edit or delete action, and direct backend requests to
  mutate them fail.
- Creating or updating a custom role with zero permissions fails in both the UI
  flow and backend service.
- Owner-only grants and covering wildcards cannot be assigned to a custom role.
- Permission retrieval failure is distinct from a successful empty catalog and
  provides retry without resetting name, code, status, description, or selected
  permissions.
- Disabling a role removes its capabilities from affected users after the
  successful update while preserving the role and its user associations.
- Deleting an assigned role fails without removing the role or assignments.
- Every new fixed message has Simplified Chinese and English presentation.

## Assumptions, open questions, rejected and deferred decisions

### Assumptions

- The existing capability catalog remains the authority for assignable
  permissions.

### Open questions

- None that block this slice.

### Rejected

- Permissionless custom roles.
- Editing built-in roles through the generic role form.
- Treating permission-load failure as an empty catalog.
- Granting owner-only capabilities through a custom role.

### Deferred

- Role templates, cloning, bulk operations, hierarchy, and time-limited grants.
- Field-level mapping of every backend validation error.

## Ready for role-definition management completion

The product behavior, permission boundary, failure semantics, data effects,
non-goals, and acceptance criteria are fixed. Selected-source visual details
remain with `ui-spec`, and source changes remain with their implementation
owners.
